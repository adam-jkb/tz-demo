this project uses the CMake build system

cubeide can run this, it needs to be imported as a CMake project, and its launch config needs to be set similarly as with other TZ projects
it disables auto-build for the project but i'm sure there's a workaround

it was made with vscode and cubemx, and is generally easier to use there.
to build and run the project on vscode an extensions.json is provided with the dependencies, upon opening the project vscode should offer to install these extensions
it is also necessary to have cubeclt or its components independently installed, along with the STMicro flavored OpenOCD
their paths also need to be set in launch.json/tasks.json
